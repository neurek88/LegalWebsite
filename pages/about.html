                    <p class="indented">The legal community has long recognized a large gap in people's inability to obtain civil legal services for individuals  of  low  to  moderate  incomes.  Traditionally, the legal community has responded to this issue by encouraging individual lawyers and non-profits to provide free legal services to clients.  While we feel that both endeavors are needed and admirable, studies have shown that these processes alone are not enough to serve everyone of low to moderate income with affordable quality legal services. The high cost of legal services and the inability of non-profits and volunteer attorneys to provide services to all persons of low to moderate  income has forced these clients to either attempt to navigate the legal process alone or turn away from the legal process all together. <br>
    </p><p class="indented">The National Center for State Courts has shown that in general, only 28 percent of domestic relations (family law) cases have counsel representing both parties (source 1). <b> Requiring persons of moderate to low–income to traverse through complicated legal procedures alone only puts more stress on already tense legal situations. This can make them feel rejected by a body of law created to protect them.</b>
    </p><p class="indented">Those who do not undertake the extra stress of representing themselves, will often never seek legal solutions at all.  Studies show that when comparing high-income and low-income groups in filing a legal action when they are entitled to justice, only 7 percent of high-income individuals opt not to seek legal solution when they have a credible cause of action, whereas, 30 percent of low-income individuals opt not to file an action, even when they are entitled to (source 2). Thus,<b> almost 1/3 of people outside of the high-income range will not use the legal system available to them when they have the right to it. It is likely that this disparity comes from people in these income ranges feeling that they cannot afford a lawyer's fees to be able to take advantage of the legal system.</b>  A survey in 2005 asked Californian residents whether “the cost of hiring an attorney (kept/might keep) you from going to court"; a whopping 69 percent of people agreed with that proposition (source 3). </p>
